### Recommendations

[Google's Style Guide for Python](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) is an excellent resource for style recommendations.

### Project 1: Docker + Python CLI
Build a Docker image that runs a Python application which accepts --filepath and --delimiter arguments.
Use `argparse`, `logging`, `csv` and a multi-processing library of your choice such as `concurrent.futures`. You should include functions/methods, exception handling, type anotations, helpful comments, and intuitive naming conventions. Avoid using Pandas for this exercise.

See `project-1` for details.
