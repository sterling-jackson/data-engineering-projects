# Data Engineering Projects
A collection of projects to learn data engineering and demonstrate proficiency with the various tools, technologies, and concepts that are relevant within the data engineering field.

### Project 1: Docker + Python CLI
Build a Docker image that runs a Python application which accepts --filepath and --delimiter arguments.
Use `argparse`, `logging`, `csv` and a multi-processing library of your choice such as `concurrent.futures`. You should include functions/methods, exception handling, type anotations, helpful comments, and intuitive naming conventions. Avoid using Pandas for this exercise.

See PROJECT1.md for details.
